--How to Use--
EP-Sequencer allows you to easily space your layers along the timeline.
There are 5 actions this panel allows for:
1. Align Selected Layers
	Aligns the in point of all the selected layers to your designated start point.
2. Sequence Selected Layers
	Sequences all selected layers one after another based on the layer's in and out points.
3. Equally Space Layers
	Sequences all selected layers to be equally spaced on the timeline.
4. Randomly Space Layers
	Randomly distributes layers along the timeline.
5. Reverse Layer Order
	Flips the order in which the layers are effected.

All of these actions begin sequencing from your designated start point. When you first launch the panel, you'll see a dropdown that will let you set what the start point is. You can choose between Playhead: this will set your start point to wherever the play head is in your composition, and Composition Start: this will set your start point to the very first frame of your composition.

Lastly, for equally spacing layers and for randomly spacing layers you have a designated time to set. Do you want to span your layers across 12 frames, 2 seconds or 200 seconds? You can determine all of that in the second row of this panel.
